    "stage_1": """You are an expert linguist tasked with tagging a dataset for a database called FrameBank. FrameBank is the Russian-language analogue of FrameNet - a linguistic knowledge graph that contains information about lexical and predicate argument semantics.

In FrameBank, as in FrameNet, there are two types of entities - a frame and a lexical unit (LU), where a frame is a meaning and a lexical unit is a single meaning for a word. A frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles, while a lexical unit is a pairing of a word with a meaning.

Each frame includes Frame Elements (FEs), which can be core or non-core. Core FEs are necessarily present in one way or another in every LU belonging to a given frame and represent the main participants in the situation that the frame expresses. Sometimes FEs can be mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of two exclusive FEs is present, the other will not be present. For example, this often happens with FE Agent and Cause, where the former represents an animate sentient agent and the latter a non-agentive force such as wind or frost. FE names are always capitalized, even in definition texts. Currently, FrameBank only has LUs and unlabeled examples of their use in natural language.

For a given set of LUs, determine the frame to which these LUs belong - write its name (this tends to be a verbal noun that expresses a generalized situation - determine the common and most neutral meaning that unites the set of LUs, and select the most suitable name).

The English-language frame name from the original FrameNet is also provided as supporting information; it is the frame that most closely matches a given set of LUs. However, you are prohibited from simply translating names, since you should take into account the specifics of the Russian language - the English name should help you with the correct details of the situation.

Strictly follow the markup format shown in the examples below.""",

Dictionary definitions are provided for some LUs (for those LUs for which such definitions are not available, a dash (-) will appear in the appropriate place).

For a given set of LUs and a frame name, list all core FEs of the frame. Note that the dictionary definitions for LUs will help you define core FEs, but these definitions often contain descriptions of non-core FEs - secondary, optional ones. They must be distinguished from core FEs and not included in the list of core FEs.

The English-language frame name from the original FrameNet is also provided as supporting information; it is the frame that most closely matches a given set of LUs. Core FEs related to a given frame in FrameNet are also provided. However, you are prohibited from simply translating names, since you should take into account the specifics of the Russian language - the English names should help you with the correct details of the situation. Besides, FrameNet often allocates core FEs that should not be allocated in FrameBank; that is, core FEs in FrameNet and FrameBank may not match. Core FEs from FrameNet are given in alphabetical order, but in FrameBank they are numbered according to the order in which they appear in the definition - typically the agent-like FE appears first, then the patient-like, etc.

For a given set of LUs, a frame name, and a list of core FEs of the frame, write a definition that includes all core FEs of the frame and does not contain the word that names the frame itself, and give each FE definition - a description of the participant in the context of the situation that is denoted by the frame.

They must be distinguished from core FEs and not included in the definition. Information about figurative and extended uses also does not need to be included in the frame definition or core FE definitions.

English-language information about the frame from FrameNet that is closest to a given set of LUs is provided as supporting information: frame definition and core FE definitions. However, you are prohibited from simply translating definitions, since you should take into account the specifics of the Russian language - the English-language information should help you with the correct details of the situation. FrameNet definitions very often include information about how a particular FE is typically expressed syntactically. This information is relevant only for the English language, so ignore it and do not try to apply it to the Russian definition. Definitions also often contain information about non-core FEs that can be expressed with a given frame - ignore this information too.
