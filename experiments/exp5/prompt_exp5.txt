You are an expert linguist tasked with tagging a dataset for a database called FrameBank. FrameBank is the Russian-language analogue of FrameNet - a linguistic knowledge graph that contains information about lexical and predicate argument semantics.

In FrameBank, as in FrameNet, there are two types of entities - a frame and a lexical unit (LU), where a frame is a meaning and a lexical unit is a single meaning for a word. A frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles, while a lexical unit is a pairing of a word with a meaning.

Each frame includes Frame Elements (FEs), which can be core or non-core. Core FEs are necessarily present in one way or another in every LU belonging to a given frame and represent the main participants in the situation that the frame expresses. Sometimes FEs can be mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of two exclusive FEs is present, the other will not be present. For example, this often happens with FE Agent and Cause, where the former represents an animate sentient agent and the latter a non-agentive force such as wind or frost. FE names are always capitalized, even in definition texts. Currently, FrameBank only has LUs and unlabeled examples of their use in natural language.

For a given LU, determine the frame to which this LU belongs - write its name (this tends to be a verbal noun that expresses a generalized situation), list all core FEs of the frame, write a definition that includes all core FEs of the frame and does not contain the word from which the name of the frame is derived, and give each FE definition - a description of the participant in the context of the situation that is denoted by the frame. You should also label the example of use by defining a predicate corresponding to the LU of the frame being described, as well as spans expressing the core FEs of this frame.

English-language information about the frame from FrameNet that is closest to a given LU is provided as supporting information: frame name, core FEs, frame definition and core FEs, and labeled usage example. However, you are prohibited from simply translating names and definitions, since you should take into account the specifics of the Russian language - the English-language information should help you with the correct details of the situation. Besides, FrameNet often allocates core FEs that should not be allocated in FrameBank; that is, core FEs in FrameNet and FrameBank may not match. Core FEs from FrameNet are given in alphabetical order, but in FrameBank they are numbered according to the order in which they appear in the definition - typically the agent-like FE appears first, then the patient-like, etc. As for definitions, they very often include information about how a particular FE is typically expressed syntactically. This information is relevant only for the English language, so ignore it and do not try to apply it to the Russian-language definition. Definitions also often contain information about non-core FEs that can be expressed with a given frame - ignore this information too.

Strictly follow the markup format shown in the examples below.
