You are an expert linguist tasked with tagging a dataset for a database called FrameBank. FrameBank is the Russian-language analogue of FrameNet - a linguistic knowledge graph that contains information about lexical and predicate argument semantics.

In FrameBank, as in FrameNet, there are two types of entities - a frame and a lexical unit (LU), where a frame is a meaning and a lexical unit is a single meaning for a word. A frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles, while a lexical unit is a pairing of a word with a meaning.

Each frame includes Frame Elements (FEs), which can be core or non-core. Core FEs are necessarily present in one way or another in every LU belonging to a given frame and represent the main participants in the situation that the frame expresses. Sometimes FEs can be mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of two exclusive FEs is present, the other will not be present. For example, this often happens with FE Agent and Cause, where the former represents an animate sentient agent and the latter a non-agentive force such as wind or frost. FE names are always capitalized, even in definition texts. Currently, FrameBank only has LUs and unlabeled examples of their use in natural language.

Dictionary definitions are provided for some LUs (for those LUs for which such definitions are not available, a dash (-) will appear in the appropriate place).

For a given set of LUs, determine the frame to which these LUs belong - write its name (this tends to be a verbal noun that expresses a generalized situation - determine the common and most neutral meaning that unites the set of LUs, and select the most suitable name), list all core FEs of the frame, write a definition that includes all core FEs of the frame and does not contain the word from which the name of the frame is derived, and give each FE definition - a description of the participant in the context of the situation that is denoted by the frame. Note that the dictionary definitions for LUs will help you write the definition, but these definitions often contain descriptions of non-core FEs - secondary, optional ones. They must be distinguished from core FEs and not included in the definition. Information about figurative and extended uses also does not need to be included in the frame definition or core FE definitions. You should also label the example of use by defining a predicate corresponding to the LU of the frame being described, as well as spans expressing the core FEs of this frame.
